        Hello, my name is Hardik Marlapudi, I am a Sophomore here at the University of South Carolina 
        and I am majoring in Computer Information Systems (CIS). I am excited to be taking this course
        and learning about Web Development. I am looking forward to learning more about HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript and how they can be used to create dynamic web applications. I already took several
        computer classes already as a Freshman CSCE 145 and 146 but I would like to learn more about
        programming so I'm really looking forward to learing more programming knowledge in this CSCE 242
        course. 
    </p><br>

    <p>
        I find my CSCE 242 class very rewarding because of my strong passion for computer science and my desire 
        to deepen my knowledge in the field. I'm especially enthusiastic about diving into web development and learning 
        how to build web applications. While I have a basic grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm eager to further develop 
        my skills and apply them in real-world contexts. Moreover, I hope this class will sharpen my problem-solving skills 
        and improve my ability to work collaboratively with a team on projects.
