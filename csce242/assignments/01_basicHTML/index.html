        Hello, my name is Hardik Marlapudi, I am a Sophomore here at the University of South Carolina 
        and I am majoring in Computer Information Systems (CIS). I am excited to be taking this course
        and learning about Web Development. I am looking forward to learning more about HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript and how they can be used to create dynamic web applications. I already took several
        computer classes already as a Freshman CSCE 145 and 146 but I would like to learn more about
        programming so I'm really looking forward to learing more programming knowledge in this CSCE 242
        course. 
    </p><br>

    <p>
        I like my CSCE 242 class because I am very interested in
        the field of computer science and I am excited to learn more about it.
        I am looking forward to learning more about web development and how to
        create web applications. I already have a basic knowlwdge of HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript, but I am excited to learn more about these topics and
        how to apply them in a real-world setting. I also hope that this class
        will help me to improve my problem-solving skills and to learn how to
        work with a team to complete a project.
