            <p>Hello there, my name is Hardik Marlapudi. I'm a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of South Carolina, majoring in Computer Information Systems (CIS). 
            As an enthusiastic and outgoing individual, I thrive on meeting new people and forging meaningful connections. I believe that every interaction is an opportunity to learn and grow, 
            and I approach each one with an open mind and a positive attitude. My passion for technology is a driving force in my life. I am deeply committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements, 
            which fuels my desire to continuously expand my knowledge and skills. This commitment aligns with my long-term goal of becoming a proficient IT professional, capable of making significant contributions to the field. 
            I embrace challenges with determination and strive for excellence in all my endeavors, whether they are academic, personal, or professional. In addition to my technical pursuits, I take pride in being a good listener and a supportive friend. 
            I find immense satisfaction in helping others navigate their own challenges, whether through offering guidance or simply lending a sympathetic ear. My dedication to assisting those around me reflects my belief in the power of collaboration and community. 
            My eagerness to assist, combined with my unwavering commitment to my goals, are fundamental aspects of who I am. I look forward to continuing my journey, both academically and personally, with enthusiasm and a readiness to embrace new opportunities.
