                    <p>Assignment 9: For Loops, you are tasked with creating a webpage that allows users to draw stars based on their input, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user inputs the number of stars they want to draw, and the stars are displayed randomly within a black canvas area. If the user inputs an invalid number (such as a number less than or equal to zero), an error message is shown. Each star is clickable, and when clicked, an alert displays the star's index, indicating which star was clicked. The layout of the page includes a simple interface with input fields, a draw button, and a canvas area where stars appear. The use of for loops is integral to drawing multiple stars, and random placement ensures variety in the positions of the stars on the screen. The assignment also emphasizes the use of modern JavaScript practices, such as arrow functions and proper code formatting. This project combines logical validation, user interaction, and visual design elements to create an engaging, interactive experience.</p>

                    <p>In Project Part 6: JSON File, you are required to build upon the work done in previous project parts by incorporating the use of JSON data and dynamically displaying the content on your website. You will create a JSON file that contains a list of at least 8 items related to your website’s topic. Each item in the JSON file will have several fields: a unique ID (_id), a relative link to an image stored on the site, an array with at least three pieces of information (such as chapters, authors, etc.), and at least four other fields of information relevant to the item. The images for each item should be placed in an 'images' directory on your website, and their links should be relative paths.</p>

                    <p>In Project Part 7, the task involves implementing a client-side form validation and submission process using HTML and JavaScript. The project requires creating a "Contact Me" form that allows users to send an email when the form is properly filled out. The form should include proper HTML validation for fields like name, email, and message, and display success or error messages based on submission status, all handled asynchronously without redirecting the user to another page. Additionally, the project includes embedding an iframe, such as a Google map or YouTube video, that adjusts responsively for different screen sizes, ensuring a visually appealing layout. The design must maintain professional alignment and be fully responsive across all devices. Lastly, the project needs to be linked from the main project section of the course website for easy navigation.</p>

                    <p>Project Part 8 involves converting your existing project site into a React application, hosted as a GitHub Pages site. The assignment requires creating a new GitHub repository specifically for this React project, where you will build the site from scratch. This React site must include all existing pages, styles, and images from your original project, and it should be organized into distinct pages and components. Each component and page should have its own associated stylesheet, where applicable, to ensure a modular structure. The project site must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes, with a menu that adjusts to display vertically on smaller resolutions. Additionally, list items should be organized into reusable components, preparing them for dynamic content when the data will later be pulled from JSON files. While the current focus is on establishing the React structure, forms, toggle navigation, iframe embedding, and JSON data fetching are not required for this part of the project. The completed React application will then be deployed as a static website on GitHub Pages, and a link to the site should be added to the project section of your main 242 home page. This assignment emphasizes organizing a site using React components, achieving responsive design, and deploying a React site as a GitHub Pages project.</p>

                    <p>In Project Part 9, the goal is to convert your existing project site into a fully functional React application with enhanced interactivity and backend integration. You’ll address any issues from previous parts, ensuring a polished and responsive design across devices. Key additions include a contact form, a working toggle navigation, and the ability to pull live data from an Express server hosted on Render. This server will store data as an array (previously JSON), which the React front end can fetch dynamically. The project requires you to break down the site into well-organized pages and components, with individual stylesheets where needed. Additionally, the server should display a styled index.html page documenting available API endpoints, allowing users or developers to understand and interact with the data sources effectively. This project emphasizes the integration of client-side and server-side technologies to create a seamless and responsive user experience.</p><br>

                    <p>In Project Part 11, you will enhance your Library Webpage Program by adding Edit and Delete functionalities for managing the list of books. This involves implementing features on both the client and server sides. On the client side, you will use React to create a seamless user experience by incorporating properties, state, and components effectively. Users will be able to edit or delete items using a form, which will include client-side validation that aligns with the server-side Joi validation. When a user successfully edits an item, the updated data will be displayed immediately without requiring a page refresh, reflecting the changes dynamically. Similarly, when an item is deleted, it will be removed from the list upon receiving a successful response from the server. A state variable will indicate the success of these operations, ensuring clear feedback for the user. All components and the interface should be styled and integrated cohesively for a polished look.
                        On the server side, you will build upon your existing Node.js and Express repository by adding PUT and DELETE endpoints. These endpoints will validate the data using Joi, perform the necessary updates or deletions in the data array, and return a response indicating whether the operation was successful. Together, these features aim to create a robust, interactive, and user-friendly system for managing the library's book data.</p><br>

                    <p>The objective of Project Part 12 is to enhance the server-side functionality of the Library Webpage Program by integrating MongoDB for persistent data management. This involves installing necessary MongoDB extensions, establishing a connection to the database, and designing a schema to structure the data effectively, including a field for uploading pictures. 
                        Using this schema, the project requires implementing CRUD operations—POST, PUT, and DELETE requests—to allow users to create, update, and remove data while ensuring these changes are stored persistently. Data validation will be maintained using Joi to guarantee accuracy and consistency. Additionally, the project includes enabling picture uploads that remain functional throughout the session, even if they do not persist after a server reload due to the limitations of the free hosting plan. As this is the final deliverable, both the client-side and server-side code must be fully integrated and functional, providing a seamless and robust user experience.</p><br>
