                    <p>This assignment, allows students to build Flexboxes and Grid layout systems, two powerful CSS techniques that are essential for building responsive and well-structured web page layouts. Flexbox provides a flexible way to align and distribute space among items within a container, making it ideal for creating dynamic and adaptive designs. Grid, on the other hand, allows for the creation of complex, grid-based layouts that can be precisely controlled and easily adjusted for different screen sizes. By exploring these layout systems, students will learn how to design web pages that not only look great but also maintain their structure and usability across various devices and screen resolutions. This assignment will equip students with the skills necessary to build modern, responsive web designs that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>

                    <p>The main home page's CSS focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive layout. It uses techniques like Flexbox or Grid to organize elements such as navigation menus, content sections, and footers. The page typically follows a consistent color scheme with defined typography for headings and body text. The navigation menu is styled with hover effects and adapts to smaller screens using media queries. Buttons and links are customized for better interactivity, while the footer is styled to remain at the bottom with contrasting colors. Overall, the CSS ensures a clean, user-friendly design that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>

                    <p>Assignment 9: For Loops, you are tasked with creating a webpage that allows users to draw stars based on their input, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user inputs the number of stars they want to draw, and the stars are displayed randomly within a black canvas area. If the user inputs an invalid number (such as a number less than or equal to zero), an error message is shown. Each star is clickable, and when clicked, an alert displays the star's index, indicating which star was clicked. The layout of the page includes a simple interface with input fields, a draw button, and a canvas area where stars appear. The use of for loops is integral to drawing multiple stars, and random placement ensures variety in the positions of the stars on the screen. The assignment also emphasizes the use of modern JavaScript practices, such as arrow functions and proper code formatting. This project combines logical validation, user interaction, and visual design elements to create an engaging, interactive experience.</p>

                    <p>Assignment 10: Arrays focuses on utilizing arrays in JavaScript to handle and manipulate data on a webpage. In this assignment, students are expected to create a webpage that dynamically displays information from an array. The array could store a variety of data types, such as numbers, strings, or objects, which are then used to populate the webpage through loops or direct access methods. Students will practice adding, removing, and modifying elements in the array, as well as iterating over the array to display multiple entries. The assignment may include functionalities such as filtering or sorting the array, displaying only specific elements, or allowing user input to interact with the array (for example, adding or removing data). The goal of the project is to enhance students' understanding of how arrays work in JavaScript and how to manipulate them to build dynamic, interactive web pages. The assignment emphasizes proper use of array methods, efficient iteration techniques, and clean code formatting.</p>

                    <p>Project Part 3: HTML and CSS focuses on transforming the wireframes into a functional web structure using HTML for content and CSS for styling. In this phase, the HTML is responsible for organizing the website's structure, defining headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS is applied to enhance the visual design, ensuring that elements like colors, fonts, and layout reflect the desired look and feel. The use of Flexbox or Grid helps create a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes. CSS variables may be used for consistency in colors and styling across the site. This phase is critical for creating a visually appealing, well-structured, and responsive website based on the initial wireframes.</p>
