            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                *Fahrenheit 451* is a dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury published in 1953. The novel is set in a future society where books are banned, and "firemen" burn any that are found. It explores themes of censorship, the power of knowledge, and the dangers of a society where critical thinking is suppressed. The protagonist, Guy Montag, begins to question the purpose of his role as a fireman and seeks out books in defiance of the oppressive system.
