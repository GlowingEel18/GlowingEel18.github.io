            <img src="Page Layout.png" alt="Screenshot of Assignment 3" width="250px" height="300px">

            <p>In this assignment, students will delve into the Flexbox and Grid layout systems, two powerful CSS techniques that are essential for building responsive and well-structured web page layouts. Flexbox provides a flexible way to align and distribute space among items within a container, making it ideal for creating dynamic and adaptive designs. Grid, on the other hand, allows for the creation of complex, grid-based layouts that can be precisely controlled and easily adjusted for different screen sizes. By exploring these layout systems, students will learn how to design web pages that not only look great but also maintain their structure and usability across various devices and screen resolutions. This assignment will equip students with the skills necessary to build modern, responsive web designs that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>
