    <center><h1>CSCE 242 Web Applications</h1></center>
    <center><h3>Hardik Marlapudi</h3></center>
    <p>I like my CSCE 242 class because I am very interested in
        the field of Computer Science and I am excited to learn more about it.
        I am looking forward to learning more about Web Development and how to
        create web applications by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also using
        Node.js to help me understand what is web development all about for this 
        class.
