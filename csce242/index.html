    <center><h3>Hardik Marlapudi</h3></center>
    <p>I like my CSCE 242 class because I am very interested in
        the field of Computer Science and I am excited to learn more about it.
        I am looking forward to learning more about Web Development and how to
        create web applications by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also using
        Node.js to help me understand what is web development all about for this 
        class. CSCE 242 offers a comprehensive introduction to web development, 
        and I am excited about the hands-on projects and practical knowledge that I will gain. 
        This course is an excellent opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of web technologies 
        and to apply them in creating functional and innovative web applications.
